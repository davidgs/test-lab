      <description>Seting up the Worker The script-worker.go file is the solution here. It will start a task worker and listen for tasks from your process. When a task is received, it will execute the task and then complete the task.
The task listener looks for 2 variables in the incoming job: count and add. If the count variable is missing, it will default to initializing it at 0. If the add variable is missing, it will default to adding 1 to the count variable.</description>

      <description>Testing your Script Worker To make sure that your script worker is working correctly, let&amp;rsquo;s run a few tests.
First, we will need to create and deploy a process that will call your script worker task.
in the script-worker.go file set the PROC_NAME constant to AddOneTask, build and start your script-worker.
There is a file test-script-worker.bpmn in this directory that you can use to create a test process. You can drag-drop this file into the Modeler tab of Camunda Cloud.</description>
