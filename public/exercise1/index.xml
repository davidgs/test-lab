      <description>Google Cloud account Later on in this lab we will be using the Google Image AI service to process images. In order to use the service, you will need to create a Google Cloud account. If you already have a google account, you can use that account.
You can login to your Google account, and then go to the Cloud Console where you can create a new project.
Once your project is created, go to the Getting Started box and click the explore and enable APIs link.</description>
