### Deploying the improved Model

Now that we have out decision table, our form, and our model, it's time to get it all up and running. First, you'll need to deploy the decision table. Open the decision table in the modeler, and click the `Deploy Diagram` button.

Once the Decision Table is deployed, you'll do the same thing with the form. Open the form in the modeler, and click the `Deploy Diagram` button.

Finally, you'll need to deploy the model. Open the model in the modeler, and click the `Deploy Diagram` button.

Now that all 3 parts of the process are deployed, you can start the process.
