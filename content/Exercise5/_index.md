### Using Decision Tables

As we saw in the previous exercise, doing everything manually in separate steps is tedious and time consuming. What if there were a way to automate more of the process so that we only had to interact with it once? This is where Decision Tables come in.

Again, all of the files are built for you if you'd like to  use them instead of building them yourself.
