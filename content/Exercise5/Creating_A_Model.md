### Creating the Model

The model is a much more simplified version of what we did in [Exercise 4](../Exercise4/index.md). We're going to create a model that only one form and has one decision table.

**Note:** Finding the `decision id` for the decision table can be a bit tricky. You can find it by opening the Decision Table, and clickin on the table itself, then looking in the Properties Panel under the `General` tab.
