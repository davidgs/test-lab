### Preparing The IoT Hardware

In this portion of the lab we will assemble the hardware components in the kit and, once build, we will configure the hardware to use in our process.

We will build the hardware, then deploy the provided firmware to the device.

Finally, we will configure the device to use the Camunda Cloud API.
