### The New Process

Since we are no longer using any forms, or any user tasks, our process is going to be very short and relatively simple.

As you can see, we have one external task, followed by a decision table, followed by the task to dispense candy (if any candy is deserved, of course).

This is, clearly, a much simplified and more efficient process that requires no human interaction. We can deploy this process and have it run, unattended, for as long as we want.

You can download the new model [here](exercise-6.bpmn) and upload it to your Cloud Modeler.
