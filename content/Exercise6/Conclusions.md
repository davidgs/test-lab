### What have we learned?

I hope that this lab has been both interesting as well as useful.

We've seen how we can iterate on a process that started out as very complicated and cumbersome, streamlined it a bit to make it easier, and then finally employed some image AI technology to make it all automated, cutting out human interaction entirely.

Some key concepts I hope you've learned:

1) How to use BPMN to automate a process
2) How to create external task workers to handle tasks
3) How to use Forms to allow humans to interact with a process
4) How to automate decisions with DMN Decision tables
5) How to completely automate a process with AI and DMN Decision tables
